# typing-test

A quick pygame app that lets you test your typing! 

After you set up your env and install the dependencies in the Pipfile
you can run 

pytest test.py

to make sure everything is working correctly. All tests should pass.

Then your typing test can begin with:  

python3 TypingTimer.py 

As this was a quick project, the UI could use improvemnts.
